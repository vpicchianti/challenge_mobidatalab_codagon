#   Codagon Challenge by MobiDataLab
The **city of Leuven** is a mid-size city with a long-term policy plan to encourage a modal shift away from private cars, aiming to get more people to use public transport, bikes, and new mobility options. However, the modal share of shared mobility services and public transport is still relatively low compared to walking or private vehicles. Furthermore, the share of people using personal motor vehicles to travel to the city centre from the peri-urban area remains very high.<br><br>

The central task of this challenge is to work on a tool to **identify and plan optimal locations and services for multimodal mobility hubs**. These hubs should seamlessly integrate various transportation modes, provide efficient park and ride solutions, and enhance accessibility to public transport and shared mobility services. The solution should be able to deal with dynamic planning, scaling up services for big events such as festivals or conferences. Your role is to use your technical prowess to create innovative tools that will drive a paradigm shift in Leuven's transportation landscape. <br><br>

_Goals and Objectives_
<br>
- *Promoting Modal Shift*: Develop solutions that encourage residents and visitors to opt for public transport, shared mobility, and sustainable travel modes over private motorised vehicles. <br>
- *Enhancing Connectivity*: Create tools that facilitate seamless transitions between different modes of transportation, thereby making travel more convenient and efficient.
- *Optimal Hub Placement*: Utilize data analytics to strategically identify locations for mobility hubs based on factors such as population density, transportation accessibility, parking facilities, and travel patterns.
- *Parking Integration*: Incorporate parking data into your solutions to enable a park and ride approach, making the shift to public transport more attractive.
- *Inclusivity and Accessibility* Design solutions that ensure accessibility for all individuals, including those with mobility challenges, by considering factors such as barrier-free routes, signage, and user-friendly interfaces.
